# Real-time_exam_cheating_detection
This project implements a real-time cheating detection system using object detection and face pose estimation. It leverages YOLOv8 for detecting suspicious objects (like phones, books, laptops) and MediaPipe for monitoring head orientation to detect when a user looks away from the screen.
